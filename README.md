# Sorting-Tutorials

Sorting is a process that organizes a collection of data into either ascending or descending order.
An internal sort requires that the collection of data fit entirely in the computer’s main memory.
We can use an external sort  when  the collection of data cannot fit in the computer’s main memory all at once but must reside in secondary storage such as on a disk.
Any significant amount of computer output is generally arranged in some sorted order so that it can be interpreted.
Sorting also has indirect uses. An initial sort of the data can significantly enhance the performance of an algorithm. 
Majority of programming projects use a sort somewhere, and in many cases, the sorting cost determines the running time.
A comparison-based sorting algorithm makes ordering decisions only on the basis of comparisons.

In the given project I've implemented a tutorialr via approach to learn various sorting tehniques. This project not only helps you to learn various sorting techiques but also show you how to implement it at various passes at a given stage.

The code is written entirely in C and is open to everyone to add more features to it. 

The current Sorting methods that I'd implemented are :
-Selection Sort 
-Insertion Sort
-Bubble Sort
-Merge Sort
-Quick Sort
-Shell Sort

More to come :
- More Sorting methods
- a GUI based approach
